**csvm.py** is simple search, delete, merge for csv files.  Good for situations where there's multiple csv files that need to be merged, parred down, or appended to on the fly. Maybe good if you aren't heavy into some of the UNIX command line tools that can do this as effectively with a little magic, so I've been told.
